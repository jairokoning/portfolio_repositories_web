## :rocket: About the challenge

In this challenge, an application was developed to train and fix the ReactJS concepts during the Bootcamp GoStack 11 promoted by [Rocketseat] (https://rocketseat.com.br/)!

The application allows you to add and remove portfolios from repositories, which are sent to an API made in Node.
